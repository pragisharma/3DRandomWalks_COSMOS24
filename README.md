# 3DRandomWalks_COSMOS24
#### Biophysics Final Project, By: Pragya, Alison, and Siyuan

### Abstract
We plan to simulate 3D random walks using spherical coordinates. (eg. cartesian --> spherical conversion) Every axes has an equal probability of moving forward or backward a random amount. The number of steps will vary to discover the pattern between the starting point and the number of steps. 2D walks are guaranteed to return back to the starting point, while 3D walks have a 34% chance of returning back to their starting point. We plan on proving this hypothesis along with graphing other statistics such as frequency the average distance away from the starting point after each walk ends.

### Statistics to be explored:
1) 3D axes with random walk plot
2) distance away from starting point vs the frequency histogram
3) distance away from the starting point vs the number of steps plot
